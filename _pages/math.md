## Math for Quant

To become a quantitative analyst, also known as a "quant", 
**strong mathematical skills are essential**. 
These skills will be the first to be evaluated in an interview. 
A deep understanding and application of mathematical tools are vital for a candidate. 
It's not merely about understanding the basics; 
comprehensive knowledge and the capacity to apply intricate 
mathematical concepts to real-world financial issues are crucial.

### [Calculus](https://bagelquant.github.io/math/calculus/)

A fundamental understanding of calculus is necessary. 
This includes concepts such as limits, continuity, 
and the different types of differentiability. 
Knowledge of multivariable calculus is also required, 
as it is used in optimization problems - a common occurrence in quantitative finance. 

### [Linear algebra](https://bagelquant.github.io/math/linear-algebra/)

Linear algebra is another important area, 
as it is the foundation for many algorithms used in machine learning and data analysis. 
Understanding matrices, vectors, and operations such as matrix multiplication and inversion is key.

### [Probability and statistics](https://bagelquant.github.io/math/probability-and-statistics/)

Probability and statistics are at the core of quantitative analysis. 
Quants must be able to understand and model uncertainty, estimate parameters, and test hypotheses. 
They also need a deep understanding of statistical inference and the ability to work with large datasets.
        
### [Differential equations](https://bagelquant.github.io/math/differential-equations/)

Differential equations are often used in quantitative finance 
to model the behavior of financial instruments over time. 
Both ordinary and stochastic differential equations are used, so a solid understanding of these is crucial.
