I've always wanted to try using Vim as my primary coding editor. Being a Vim expert is so cool, as it allows you to navigate project files efficiently and boost your coding speed using Vim's powerful motion commands. It's one of the most geeky skills I've ever encountered.

However, I used to be a JetBrains user. JetBrains IDEs offer a wealth of features, a user-friendly interface, and excellent developer tools, such as database integration.

I've already learned how to use Vim's motion commands. For the past 2 years, I've been using Vim plugins in JetBrains IDEs and VS Code. Fully migrating from JetBrains to Neovim would likely reduce my productivity significantly. Sticking with Vim plugins within IDEs seems like the obvious choice for me.

Nevertheless, using Neovim exclusively could help me better understand core programming concepts and improve my ability to use the terminal. I believe learning Vim would be a great step forward for my programming skills. After using Vim for a considerable period, I may consider switching back to IDEs with a deeper understanding of my code.

> Plus, being able to tweet "I USE VIM" would be satisfying.🐶

Hopefully, I will enjoy the process. 😃
